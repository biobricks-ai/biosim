	abstract = {The introduction of machine learning to small molecule research– an inherently multidisciplinary field in which chemists and data scientists combine their expertise and collaborate - has been vital to making screening processes more efficient. In recent years, numerous models that predict pharmacokinetic properties or bioactivity have been published, and these are used on a daily basis by chemists to make decisions and prioritize ideas. The emerging field of explainable artificial intelligence is opening up new possibilities for understanding the reasoning that underlies a model. In small molecule research, this means relating contributions of substructures of compounds to their predicted properties, which in turn also allows the areas of the compounds that have the greatest influence on the outcome to be identified. However, there is no interactive visualization tool that facilitates such interdisciplinary collaborations towards interpretability of machine learning models for small molecules. To fill this gap, we present CIME (ChemInformatics Model Explorer), an interactive web-based system that allows users to inspect chemical data sets, visualize model explanations, compare interpretability techniques, and explore subgroups of compounds. The tool is model-agnostic and can be run on a server or a workstation.},

Our primary contribution is the direct realization of molecular graphs, a task previously approached by generating linear SMILES strings instead of graphs. Our junction tree variational autoencoder generates molecular graphs in two phases, by first generating a tree-structured scaffold over chemical substructures, and then combining them into a molecule with a graph message passing network. This approach allows us to incrementally expand molecules while maintaining chemical validity at every step. We evaluate our model on multiple tasks ranging from molecular generation to optimization. Across these tasks, our model outperforms previous state-of-the-art baselines by a significant margin.},

   abstract = {Carcinogenicity testing plays an essential role in identifying carcinogens in environmental chemistry and drug development. However, it is a time-consuming and label-intensive process to evaluate the carcinogenic potency with conventional 2-years rodent animal studies. Thus, there is an urgent need for alternative approaches to providing reliable and robust assessments on carcinogenicity. In this study, we proposed a DeepCarc model to predict carcinogenicity for small molecules using deep learning-based model-level representations. The DeepCarc Model was developed using a data set of 692 compounds and evaluated on a test set containing 171 compounds in the National Center for Toxicological Research liver cancer database (NCTRlcdb). As a result, the proposed DeepCarc model yielded a Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) of 0.432 for the test set, outperforming four advanced deep learning (DL) powered quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models with an average improvement rate of 37%. Furthermore, the DeepCarc model was also employed to screen the carcinogenicity potential of the compounds from both DrugBank and Tox21. Altogether, the proposed DeepCarc model could serve as an early detection tool (https://github.com/TingLi2016/DeepCarc) for carcinogenicity assessment.},

   abstract = {<p>Virtual screening (VS) is a computational practice applied in drug discovery research. VS is popularly applied in a computer-based search for new lead molecules based on molecular similarity searching. In chemical databases similarity searching is used to identify molecules that have similarities to a user-defined reference structure and is evaluated by quantitative measures of intermolecular structural similarity. Among existing approaches, 2D fingerprints are widely used. The similarity of a reference structure and a database structure is measured by the computation of association coefficients. In most classical similarity approaches, it is assumed that the molecular features in both biological and non-biologically-related activity carry the same weight. However, based on the chemical structure, it has been found that some distinguishable features are more important than others. Hence, this difference should be taken consideration by placing more weight on each important fragment. The main aim of this research is to enhance the performance of similarity searching by using multiple descriptors. In this paper, a deep learning method known as deep belief networks (DBN) has been used to reweight the molecule features. Several descriptors have been used for the MDL Drug Data Report (MDDR) dataset each of which represents different important features. The proposed method has been implemented with each descriptor individually to select the important features based on a new weight, with a lower error rate, and merging together all new features from all descriptors to produce a new descriptor for similarity searching. Based on the extensive experiments conducted, the results show that the proposed method outperformed several existing benchmark similarity methods, including Bayesian inference networks (BIN), the Tanimoto similarity method (TAN), adapted similarity measure of text processing (ASMTP) and the quantum-based similarity method (SQB). The results of this proposed multi-descriptor-based on Stack of deep belief networks method (SDBN) demonstrated a higher accuracy compared to existing methods on structurally heterogeneous datasets.</p>},

   abstract = {The U.S. federal consortium on toxicology in the 21 st century (Tox21) produces quantitative, high-throughput screening (HTS) data on thousands of chemicals across a wide range of assays covering critical biological targets and cellular pathways. Many of these assays, and those used in other in vitro screening programs, rely on luciferase and fluorescence-based readouts that can be susceptible to signal interference by certain chemical structures resulting in false positive outcomes. Included in the Tox21 portfolio are assays specifically designed to measure interference in the form of luciferase inhibition and autofluorescence via multiple wavelengths (red, blue, and green) and under various conditions (cell-free and cell-based, two cell types). Out of 8,305 chemicals tested in the Tox21 interference assays, percent actives ranged from 0.5% (red autofluorescence) to 9.9% (luciferase inhibition). Self-organizing maps and hierarchical clustering were used to relate chemical structural clusters to interference activity profiles. Multiple machine learning algorithms were applied to predict assay interference based on molecular descriptors and chemical properties. The best performing predictive models (accuracies of ~80%) have been included in a web-based tool called InterPred that will allow users to predict the likelihood of assay interference for any new chemical structure and thus increase confidence in HTS data by decreasing false positive testing results.},

abstract = {The need to develop new tools and increase capacity to test pharmaceuticals and other chemicals for potential adverse impacts on human health and the environment is an active area of development. Much of this activity was sparked by two reports from the US National Research Council (NRC) of the National Academies of Sciences, Toxicity Testing in the Twenty-first Century: A Vision and a Strategy (2007) and Science and Decisions: Advancing Risk Assessment (2009), both of which advocated for “science-informed decision-making” in the field of human health risk assessment. The response to these challenges for a “paradigm shift” toward using new approach methodologies (NAMS) for safety assessment has resulted in an explosion of initiatives by numerous organizations, but, for the most part, these have been carried out independently and are not coordinated in any meaningful way. To help remedy this situation, a framework that presents a consistent set of criteria, universal across initiatives, to evaluate a NAM's fit-for-purpose was developed by a multi-stakeholder group of industry, academic, and regulatory experts. The goal of this framework is to support greater consistency across existing and future initiatives by providing a structure to collect relevant information to build confidence that will accelerate, facilitate and encourage development of new NAMs that can ultimately be used within the appropriate regulatory contexts. In addition, this framework provides a systematic approach to evaluate the currently-available NAMs and determine their suitability for potential regulatory application. This 3-step evaluation framework along with the demonstrated application with case studies, will help build confidence in the scientific understanding of these methods and their value for chemical assessment and regulatory decision-making.}
