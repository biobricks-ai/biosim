	abstract = {The introduction of machine learning to small molecule research– an inherently multidisciplinary field in which chemists and data scientists combine their expertise and collaborate - has been vital to making screening processes more efficient. In recent years, numerous models that predict pharmacokinetic properties or bioactivity have been published, and these are used on a daily basis by chemists to make decisions and prioritize ideas. The emerging field of explainable artificial intelligence is opening up new possibilities for understanding the reasoning that underlies a model. In small molecule research, this means relating contributions of substructures of compounds to their predicted properties, which in turn also allows the areas of the compounds that have the greatest influence on the outcome to be identified. However, there is no interactive visualization tool that facilitates such interdisciplinary collaborations towards interpretability of machine learning models for small molecules. To fill this gap, we present CIME (ChemInformatics Model Explorer), an interactive web-based system that allows users to inspect chemical data sets, visualize model explanations, compare interpretability techniques, and explore subgroups of compounds. The tool is model-agnostic and can be run on a server or a workstation.},

	abstract = {We seek to automate the design of molecules based on specific chemical properties. In computational terms, this task involves continuous embedding and generation of molecular graphs. Our primary contribution is the direct realization of molecular graphs, a task previously approached by generating linear SMILES strings instead of graphs. Our junction tree variational autoencoder generates molecular graphs in two phases, by first generating a tree-structured scaffold over chemical substructures, and then combining them into a molecule with a graph message passing network. This approach allows us to incrementally expand molecules while maintaining chemical validity at every step. We evaluate our model on multiple tasks ranging from molecular generation to optimization. Across these tasks, our model outperforms previous state-of-the-art baselines by a significant margin.},

	abstract = {Structure-activity relationships (SARs) in toxicology have enabled the formation of structural rules which, when coded as structural alerts, are essential tools in in silico toxicology. Whilst other in silico methods have approaches for their evaluation, there is no formal process to assess the confidence that may be associated with a structural alert. This investigation proposes twelve criteria to assess the uncertainty associated with structural alerts, allowing for an assessment of confidence. The criteria are based around the stated purpose, description of the chemistry, toxicology and mechanism, performance and coverage, as well as corroborating and supporting evidence of the alert. Alerts can be given a confidence assessment and score, enabling the identification of areas where more information may be beneficial. The scheme to evaluate structural alerts was placed in the context of various use cases for industrial and regulatory applications. The analysis of alerts, and consideration of the evaluation scheme, identifies the different characteristics an alert may have, such as being highly specific or generic. These characteristics may determine when an alert can be used for specific uses such as identification of analogues for read-across or hazard identification.,
